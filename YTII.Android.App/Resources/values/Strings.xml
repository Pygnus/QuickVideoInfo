      In order to use this app, you will need to set it as the default app for YouTube links.\n\n

      After first installing this, the next time you open a YouTube link, Android should prompt you to ask which application you want to open the link with.\n\n

      Select this app ("Video Previews for YouTube") from that list, then choose the "Always" option.\n\n

      If this setting ever needs to be reset, you can go into the Android Settings, under Applications, find the YouTube app, and reset the default Open With preferences.\n\n
